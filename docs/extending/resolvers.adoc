= resolvers

Set or override data fetcher for a field.

== Usage

It must be an object with the following structure:

[source,javascript]
----
resolvers: {
    <GraphQLTypeName>: {
        <fieldName>: function (env) {
            // your code here
        },
        // the rest of field resolvers ...
    },
    // the rest of type resolvers ...
}
----

== Application context

You can assume that inside resolver function you have access to the application context where extension is defined and can use `app.name` or `app.config` properties. But in the real that will be context for Guillotine application and those properties will return `com.enonic.app.guillotine` and an actual config for Guillotine application.

If you need to have access in the resolver to the application context where extension is defined, then you can store these values outside `exports.extensions`.

For example:

[source,javascript]
----
const appName = app.name;
const appConfig = app.config;

exports.extensions = function (graphQL) {
    return {
        ...
        resolvers: {
            MyCustomType: {
                myCustomField: function (env) {
                    // here you can use `appName` and `appConfig`
                }
            }
        },
        ...
   }
}
----

If the configuration of application is changed, then that will trigger restart of the application and Guillotine will update GraphQL schema. In the result you will have actual state of `app.config` in the resolver.


== DataFetchingEnvironment

A DataFetchingEnvironment instance (env) is passed to a DataFetcher as an execution context, and it's the place where you can find information to help you resolve a data value given a GraphQL field input.

Guillotine provides the following properties and function in the DataFetchingEnvironment:

- `source` - it is the value of the parent field. For the root query it is equal to `null`.
- `args` - the arguments provided to the field in the GraphQL query.
- `localContext` - a context object that parent fields may have returned. This object is unmodifiable.

The `localContext` object supports value types such as `string`, `double`, `integer`, `boolean`, and `null`. Keys with a value equal to `null` will be ignored. If you need to provide as a value a complex object, you can use the `JSON.stringify` function to convert it to a string.

The `localContext` object is unmodifiable, so you can't change it. If you need to pass some data to the lower levels, then you can use `createDataFetcherResult` function. Also, the `localContext` object provides the following properties:

- `project` - project name, taken from the current context.
- `branch` - branch name, taken from the current context.
- `siteKey` - site key, taken from the `X-Guillotine-SiteKey` header. If header is not provided, then it will be equal to `null`.

Below you can find an example of how to use these properties:

[source,javascript]
----
exports.extensions = function (graphQL) {
    return {
        ...
        resolvers: {
            MyCustomType: {
                myCustomField: function (env) {
                    const project = env.localContext.project;
                    const branch = env.localContext.branch;
                    const siteKey = env.localContext.siteKey;
                    ...
                }
            }
        },
        ...
   }
}
----

== createDataFetcherResult

Guillotine provides `createDataFetcherResult` function via `graphQL` object. This function will be useful when your `DataFetcher` retrieves data from multiple sources, or you want to pass extra context to lower levels.

The `createDataFetcherResult` function accepts an object with the following properties:

- data - the data to return, must not be `null`. Object must be wrapped by `__.toScriptValue` function.
- localContext - a key-value object that will be passed to the lower levels. This object is unmodifiable at the lowest level.
- parentLocalContext - a context object that parent fields may have returned.

If `parentLocalContext` is not provided, then `localContext` will override `parentLocalContext`. Otherwise, `localContext` will be merged with `parentLocalContext` and `localContext` will override `parentLocalContext` if they have the same keys.

If `localContext` is not provided, then `parentLocalContext` will be used as `localContext`.

Below you can find an example of how to use `createDataFetcherResult` function:

[source,javascript]
----
exports.extensions = function (graphQL) {
    return {
        ...
        resolvers: {
            MyCustomType: {
                myCustomField: function (env) {
                    return graphQL.createDataFetcherResult({
                        data: __.toScriptValue({
                           id: "100",
                        }),
                        localContext: {
                            parentId: "101",
                        },
                        parentLocalContext: env.localContext,
                    });
                }
            }
        },
        ...
   }
}
