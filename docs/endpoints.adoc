= Endpoints

This section describes the available API endpoints and how to access and expose them.

== Draft and master

The Guillotine application exposes two endpoints per content project:

* `/site/<project-name>/draft` - draft items
* `/site/<project-name>/master` - published items

As an example, when running the Enonic SDK on your local machine, you may access the items of a project called `blog`, using the following URLs:

* `http://localhost:8080/site/blog/draft` - Drafts API 
* `http://localhost:8080/site/blog/master` - Live API 

The endpoints handle both `POST` and `GET` methods, but `GET` method is only applicable for `Subscriptions` via WebSockets.

== Custom domain

When setting up Enonic XP in production, the APIs will normally not be publicly accessible. Using Vhosts, you may expose the APIs and even providing custom domain names:

Examples for a project called `myproject`.

.Example - mapping Live API to myapi.com
[source,properties]
----
mapping.my-api.host = myapi.com
mapping.my-api.source = /
mapping.my-api.target = /site/myproject/master
----

.Example - mapping Drafts API to example.com/api
[source,properties]
----
mapping.my-api.host = example.com
mapping.my-api.source = /api
mapping.my-api.target = /site/myproject/draft
----

Starting from version 6.2.0, the Guillotine exposes a new GET `/site/<project-name>` endpoint to provide a query playground with GraphiQL UI, which can be enabled or disabled via config file `com.enonic.app.guillotine.cfg`

To enable the endpoint:

.com.enonic.app.guillotine.cfg
[source,properties]
----
queryplayground.ui.mode=on
----

To disable the endpoint:

.com.enonic.app.guillotine.cfg
[source,properties]
----
queryplayground.ui.mode=off
----
The default value is determined by the XP distribution type: on server-based distributions the endpoint is off, while on SDK-based distributions it is on.
