= Setting up Guillotine

This section describes how to install and access the Guillotine API

== Installation

Guillotine is available as an Enonic app. Guillotine will normally be pre-installed when you create a new solution in the self-service cloud, or when setting up a new SDK Sandbox.

To install it manually, follow the https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/guillotine-headless-cms[instructions on Enonic Market].

== Endpoints

Once installed to your Enonic environment, Guillotine exposes two endpoints per content project:

* HTTP POST `:8080/site/<project>/draft` - Drafts API
* HTTP POST `:8080/site/<project>/master` - Live API
* HTTP GET `:8080/site/<project>` - optionally serves <<playground#, Query Playground>>

NOTE: <project> must be replaced with an actual content project in your installation.

== Enonic Cloud / Kubernetes

When using Enonic's self service hosting (or the https://developer.enonic.com/docs/kubernetes-operator-for-xp[Enonic K8s Operator]), expose the API publicly by creating an Ingress.

You may expose an entire project, or just a selected branch. The following example exposes the entire project:

In your Ingress, specify the target as `/site/<project>` (where <project> is replaced with your actual project name).

If the Ingress is example.com/api, you will now be able to access the master and draft API's on example.com/api/master and example.com/api/draft respectively.

NOTE: The draft API is access protected by default

== Using Vhosts

For other hosting options, you may explose the API on custom domains or URLs using vhosts:

Examples for a project called `myproject`.

.Example - mapping  API to myapi.com
[source,properties]
----
mapping.my-api.host = myapi.com
mapping.my-api.source = /
mapping.my-api.target = /site/<project>/master
----

.Example - mapping entire project root example.com/api
[source,properties]
----
mapping.example-api.host = example.com
mapping.example-api.source = /api
mapping.example-api.target = /site/<project>
----
