Access and test the API via the embedded API browser

== Content Studio Extension

Guillotine extends Content Studio with a new panel called Query Playground. It is only accessible for users with the `system.admin` or `cms.admin` roles.

Query Playground lets you run queries in context of your content. You may choose to query either the draft items (draft branch), or the published items (master branch).

* The left panel is used to display documentation generated from the GraphQL API
* The center panel allows you to edit your GraphQL query
* The right panel displays the result of the query execution
* Branch selector (Draft/Master) can be found in the top right corner
* Each query is executed in a specific context, which is determined by the project and the branch
