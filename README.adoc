= Guillotine - GraphQL Headless CMS for Enonic XP

== Introduction

Once assigned to your site, the guillotine application will generate dynamically a powerful GraphQL API that enables web-based access to all 
your editorial content.

Guillotine exposes the read-only part of the Enonic Content API, including access to the Enonic query language. 
Guillotine dynamically analyzes all available content types in the site and automatically generates a GraphQL API specific to your site. 
This gives you direct, typed and documented access to all content within the site. Including the ability to follow references, 
child items and access media directly.

The Guillotine API adds a new service to your site in the following path relative to the site root: /_/service/com.enonic.app.guillotine/graphql 

The fastest way to explore the Guillotine API is by adding Guillotine to an existing site (or a demo site from Enonic Market), 
then install [GraphiQL](https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/graphiql) and point it to your local site url + service path as defined above.
